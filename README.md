# EDAIRS
I took IRS2020 and 2019 data and did EDA.

Firstly, I converted amount variables into dollar variables (multiplication by 1000)  and looked at summary statistics.

Then I decided to create new variables of household (HH) averages in thoysands of $ per ZIP code (Amount/Number; NumofReturnâ€“total number of returns; for dividends and real estate (RE) taxes only calculate averages for those HH that file they have dividends or pay RE taxes) of income,  salary  income,  dividends,  and  real  estate  taxes  paid and reported  distributions and selected couple of boxplots of household averages across ZIP codes.

After that I decided to investigate what are the regions with the highest and lowest average HH salaries, income, RE taxes and dividends. 

Furthermore, I wanted to see what percentage of HH income comes from dividends.(Created a basic scaterplot and scaterplot by state)

After that I regressed HH income on the fraction receiving dividends and plotted the results as well as residuals.

Lastly, I decided to repeat the previous steps with data from 2019 and compare the results.
